"""Text-level baseline arms: HiAgent and ACON.

Both methods manage the agent's context at the TEXT level: the proxy
rewrites the request's history before it reaches the serving backend, and
the compression/summarization calls go to the SAME served ckpt-1088
endpoint (policy and compressor are the same model — the papers' own
protocol: HiAgent §4.1 uses gpt-4-turbo for both roles, ACON §4.2 uses
gpt-4.1 for both).  Cost columns must carry the compressor calls (one extra
LLM call per turn); the standing asymmetry (C2KV is trained for its
mechanism, these baselines are training-free here) is footnote material.

Sources:
* HiAgent  — arXiv 2408.09559.  The working-memory summarization prompt
  below is the PAPER's §3.3 prompt verbatim (subgoal-met judgment, one-line
  output constraint, {example} slot).  The repo's summarize.py
  (hiagent2024/hiagent @ cebdd8e) was AI-rebuilt in 2026-04 and post-dates
  the paper's numbers — audit ruling 1: not used.
  ``hiagent_summary`` contains the subgoal and observation-summarization
  components. ``hiagent_full`` additionally exposes Trajectory Retrieval as
  a proxy-owned meta-tool: the proxy expands selected completed trajectories
  and retries policy generation without forwarding retrieval to the task.
  ``full`` names the included method components, not a claim that this
  tool-native adaptation reproduces the paper's benchmark numbers; its
  task-specific in-context example slot remains empty below.
  - The repo's gripper/blocksworld summarization-off special case
    (cme_final.py:115-120) is NOT inherited (ruling 3: that is the paper's
    w/o-OS ablation, not the method).
  - User turns are NOT action-observation pairs: they survive verbatim in
    the output AND ride along in the summarizer input as "User:" lines
    (audit: a "$300 budget" constraint was silently dropped otherwise).
  - Compressor decode per paper §4.1: max_tokens~100, stop "\n\n",
    temperature 0, top_p 1; enable_thinking off (serving stack has no
    reasoning parser).
  - Degeneration is VISIBLE: when no assistant content ever declares a
    Subgoal (e.g. pure tool-call replies), the arm is a passthrough and
    stats["degenerate"] is True.
* ACON     — arXiv 2510.00615.  Thresholds per paper appendix B.3:
  T_obs = 1024 tok (~4096 chars), history 4096 tok, preserve the last ONE
  action/observation PAIR = k=2 messages. ``base`` uses the official repo's
  initial ``context_opt`` guidelines (microsoft/acon @ d63f9ae); ``ut`` and
  ``ut_co`` use the paper appendix's fixed guidelines after the utility and
  utility-plus-compression optimization steps respectively.
  Source/licensing: the base templates come from microsoft/acon @ d63f9ae
  under its MIT License; the UT and UT+CO templates are transcribed from
  Appendix D of arXiv:2510.00615v3, whose arXiv HTML is CC BY 4.0.
  History/observation are evaluated SEPARATELY by the paper (ruling 6):
  arms keep the two faces and guideline stages explicit in their names.
  Summary is embedded into the first user prompt as a <HISTORY_SUMMARY>
  block (the original memory.py:481-498 shape), not a standalone message.

Token counts are estimated as chars/4 (no tokenizer in the proxy); the
estimate is recorded in stats.

Trigger note (2026-09-05 rewrite): faithful to the upstream — the
history compression fires when est(prev_summary + messages since the last
compression) exceeds T_hist (the first compression measures the raw
history alone, tool_calls included in the estimate); between compressions
the policy SEES the summary block + every new raw turn + the preserved
action/observation pair.  An earlier port compressed every turn past the
threshold and dropped the raw recent context — that was NOT conservative,
it removed ACON's recent-context signal.  Summaries are cached per content hash; an
EMPTY compressor result is a failure and is never cached.

1. Reasoning (<=40 words)
- Briefly state what was kept and why; note dropped categories and any pagination needs.

2. Refined Observation (use ONLY the current observation)
- Keep strictly necessary data for the next step.
- Always preserve, when present:
  - access_token or other auth values
  - page_limit, page_index and other defaults that affect calls
  - every endpoint name; include parameters only if required; description <= 4 words
  - identifiers/fields needed for comparisons, loops, or API calls (ids, titles, counts, paths, etc.)
- Minimise length:
  - Delete unused fields and narrative text.
  - Compress JSON/arrays (one object per line, no extra spaces).
  - Summarise long uniform lists with a range/pattern when individual rows are not needed.
- Never invent, alter, or omit a required literal.
- Exclude history, prior summaries, and meta comments.
